            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I’ve been passionate about video games since I was very young, and that passion has stayed with me into
                adulthood.
                For a long time, I didn’t know how to turn that passion into a career until recently. I enrolled in The
                Tech Academy,
                a coding bootcamp that helped guide my love for gaming in the right direction.
                <br><br>
                There is something powerful about creating something from nothing and turning an idea into reality.
                It truly feels like bringing a dream to life. Realizing that I could actually build games myself is what
                led me
                to pursue a career as a video game developer.
                <br><br>
                As a lifelong gamer, I have watched trends evolve and understand what resonates most with passionate
                players like me.
                That experience inspired me to create my own games designed to capture that feeling and share my vision
                with the world.
